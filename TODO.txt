*Going to need a standard cutscene where I can give messages
-First person blink, staring up at stars (actual earth sky, differing in brightness, or Ë™ stars)
-"Where am I?"... "Who am I?"...
-Wake up with no memories except a longing and the direction up
-"It's dangerous to go alone take this" - get macbook
-Start SpaceX
-Memories slowly start to come back
-Start building SAIs to analyze data from huge telescope arrays trying to find her
-Realizes need more power, only place with enough is at center of galaxy
-Reaches center of galaxy, builds SAI, as tells location of her, the whole thing crashes and you are sucked into a wormhole (back to beginning)

~Maybe store intro in cookies, and use as login for actual DB user? This way also you only store data if user keeps playing

Pre intro load screen w/description (Ascii art puzzle rpg blah blah blah)
